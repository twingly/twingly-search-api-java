# Twingly Search API Java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twingly/twingly-search-api-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twingly/twingly-search-api-java)

Java client for Twingly Search API (previously known as Twingly Analytics API). Twingly is a blog search service that provides a searchable API known as [Twingly Search API](https://developer.twingly.com/resources/search/).

## Installation

Get the latest release from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22twingly-search%22).

## Usage

```Java
import com.twingly.search.*;
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        String apiKey = "API_KEY";
        // create Client object using your API key
        Client client = new UrlConnectionClient(apiKey);
        String q = "spotify";
        Result result = client.makeRequest(q);
        // Get the total number of matches returned
        int numberOfMatchesReturned = result.getNumberOfMatchesReturned();
        // Get the total number of matches to the search query
        int numberOfMatchesTotal = result.getNumberOfMatchesTotal();
        // Get number of seconds it took to execute query
        double secondsElapsed = result.getSecondsElapsed();
        for (Post p : result.getPosts()){
            System.out.println(p.getUrl());             // print url for each post
            System.out.println(p.getTitle());           // print title for each post
        }
    }
}
```

To learn more about the features of this client, check out the example code that can be found in [example](example).

To learn more about the capabilities of the API, please read the [Twingly Search API documentation].

### API key from Java system properties

Additionally, you can create Client object with API key from Java system properties (property name is `TWINGLY_SEARCH_KEY`):

```Java
import com.twingly.search.client.*;
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Client client = new UrlConnectionClient(); // create client object with API key from java system property
    }
}
```

To do so, you will need to run Java with property. For example, run your own `jar` file with twingly search key property:

```
java -jar myJar.jar -DTWINGLY_SEARCH_KEY=some_key_value
```

### Exception handling

Given exception hierarchy is now available:
* TwinglySearchException - super class for any TwinglySearch-related exception
    * TwinglySearchErrorException - super class exceptions, that have some Error details from Twingly Search API response
        * TwinglySearchServerException - exceptions that happened on the API side
        * TwinglySearchClientException - exceptions that happened due to Client misconfiguration or incorrect query
          * TwinglySearchAuthenticationException - exception that happened due to Client Authentication problems
          * TwinglySEarchQueryException - exception that happened due to problems with Query

Check documentation [Error paragraph][error] for additional information.

## Requirements

* API key, [sign up](https://www.twingly.com/try-for-free) via [twingly.com](https://www.twingly.com/) to get one
* Java:
    * v 1.7
    * v 1.8

## Development

### Tests

Make sure you have all the dependencies

```
gradlew assemble
```

Run the tests

```
gradlew check
```

Generate coverage report, using [JaCoCo]. Note that you need to run the tests first.

```
gradlew jacocoTestReport

open build/jacocoHtml/index.html
```

[JaCoCo]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html

#### Betamax

To be able to run the Betamax-based tests you need to add Betamax's certificate into Java's trust store, `cacerts`:

```
sudo keytool -importcert -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file betamax.pem -alias betamax -storepass changeit -noprompt
```

It is adviced to remove the certificate after testing is done:

```
sudo keytool -delete -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -alias betamax -storepass changeit -noprompt
```

Note that the temporary files generated by Betamax:

* api.twingly.com.jks
* api.twingly.com.cert
* api.twingly.com.csr
* betamax-local.jks

need to be removed if generated __before__ Betamax's certificate was added to the trust store, tests will fail otherwise.

For more information, check out [Betamax's SSL configuration documentation](https://github.com/betamaxteam/betamax/tree/b65a972d239d1acadd2f9911c3697d263aa20729#ssl-configuration).

### JavaDoc generation

To generate java docs just run gradle task `javadoc`:

```
gradlew javadoc
```

This will save javadocs in `docs` folder under build-folder.

### One-jar generation

To generate one fat jar library with all compile dependencies just run gradle task `generateOneJar`:

```
gradlew generateOneJar
```

This will save JAR file with all needed dependencies in `build/libs/` with `-all` suffix. (like `twingly-search-api-java-all-0.0.1.jar`)

### Release

#### Before you start

* Ensure that you have a properly setup
    * `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` ([see the example](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html#credentials))
    * [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) keyring
        * `brew install gpg`
        * get the secret key from our secret stash
        * `gpg --import <path to key>`
            * Note: if you use gpg2 you may need to [export the key](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33129703) to the older format

#### Make the release

1. Ensure you are using Java 7
1. Bump the version in [`version.properties`](./src/main/resources/version.properties)
1. Commit the changes
1. Tag the current commit with the same version number and push it
1. Run `gradlew uploadArchives -Prelease` to release to the staging repository
1. Log into [Nexus Repository Manager](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and [find the archive](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html#locate-and-examine-your-staging-repository)
1. Read [Releasing the Deployment](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html)
1. Release to Central Repository using [Nexus Repository Manager](https://oss.sonatype.org/)

#### Update the changelog

* Install [GitHub Changelog Generator](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator/) if you don't have it
    * `gem install github_changelog_generator`
* Set `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN` to a personal access token to increase your GitHub API rate limit
* Generate the changelog
